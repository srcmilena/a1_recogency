### Individual activity 1, from module 1 of Recode's bootcamp
Project proposed to be done to create a travel agency, where it was necessary to develop a series of systems to organize the clients' information, present the services and improve the services offered. 
In this activity, the concepts of structured programming, UML modeling, and object-oriented in Java were used to build a travel agency model.  

### Using pseudocode 
There was involvement of structured programming concepts (Arrays), it was created, in pseudocode, a menu to simulate a registration for a travel agency with the following data: 
- Customer registration;
- Destination registration.
A query was also created for each data structure.           

### Using Unified Modeling Language (UML)/Java
The classes, attributes and methods were also created in UML, drawing the model of the travel agency. Also implemented the classes in Java and simulated the creation of some objects.
